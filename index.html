		<h3 class="title">About Us</h3>
    <p>Loving and compassionate towards each other and living things. Unsuspectingly funny, dance-y, helpful, and kind but with a dash of road-rage.</p>
    <p>We like to be outside hiking, riding bicycles, showshoeing, skiing, walking, playing soccer or basketball or lawn games. We love to travel and go to live events like concerts, Sounders, Mariners, UW Football, Seahawks games, and Timberwolves games when visiting Minnesota in the winter.</p>
    <p>Natalie loves to read in her free time, too. Ryan loves to take drumming lessons. Ryan used to cook all of the meals but ever since Ryan made fun of Natalie for eating Spaghetti Os, Natalie has elevated her cooking skills to an unprecedented level.</p>

		<h3 class="title">Our engagement</h3>
		<p>During August of 2016, we planned a road trip around a concert at Red Rocks Amphitheater outside of Denver. The first leg of the trip put us at Yellowstone National Park, where we spent time hiking and sightseeing. On our third day in Yellowstone, we got up early and drove out to the northwest area of the park to see buffalo, big horn sheep, elk and bear. Then, with the sun fully up and the beautiful day upon us, we stopped at Tower Falls and hiked along the Yellowstone River with the sunshine streaming down. On that bright, clear morning in Yellowstone, Ryan dropped to one knee, pulled the ring from his camera bag and asked Natalie to be his wife. The rest of the trip became a celebration, from Denver to Southern Utah and back home, we had a spectacular time!</p>
